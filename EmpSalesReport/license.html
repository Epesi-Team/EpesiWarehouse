You agree to use reasonable efforts, and to take the same precautions

restriction on disclosure.

that Telaxus LLC has and will retain all ownership rights in the
Licensed Software and its documentation and all related patents,

No rights or licenses are granted by Telaxus LLC under this License,
expressly or by implication, with respect to any proprietary
information or patent, copyright, trade secret, or other intellectual
property right owned or controlled by Telaxus LLC, except as expressly
provided in this License.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">TERMINATION. </span>This

<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">GOVERNMENT END USERS</span>.
If You are acquiring the Software on behalf of any unit or agency of
the United States Government, the following provisions apply. The
Government agrees the Software and documentation were developed at
private expense and are provided with "RESTRICTED RIGHTS". Use,
duplication, or disclosure by the Government is subject to restrictions
as set forth in FAR 52.227-14, DFAR 252.227-7013, its successors or
applicable agency rights in technical data or computer software. In the
event that this License, or any part thereof, is deemed inconsistent
with the minimum rights identified in the Restricted Rights provisions,
the minimum rights shall prevail.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY ON SOFTWARE</span>.
You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Software is at your
sole risk. The Software and related documentation are provided "AS IS"
and without warranty of any kind and Telaxus LLC expressly disclaims
all warranties, express and implied, including, but not limited to, the
implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular
purpose. Telaxus LLC does not warrant that the features contained in
the software will meet Your requirements, or that the operation of the
software will be uninterrupted or error-free, or that defects in the
software will be corrected. The entire risk as to the results and
performance of the software is assumed by You. Furthermore, Telaxus LLC
does not warrant or make any representations regarding the use or the
results of the use of the Software or related documentation in terms of
their correctness, accuracy, reliability, currentness, or otherwise. No
oral or written information or advice given by Telaxus LLC or Telaxus
LLC's authorized representative shall create a warranty or in any way
increase the scope of this warranty. Should the software prove
defective, You (and not Telaxus LLC or Telaxus LLC's authorized
representative) assume the entire cost of all necessary servicing,
repair or correction. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of
implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to You.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</span>
Under no circumstances including negligence, shall Telaxus LLC, or its
directors, officers, employees or agents, be liable to You for any
incidental, indirect special or consequential damages (including
damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of
business information, and the like) arising out of the use, misuse or
inability to use the software or related documentation, breach or
default including those arising from infringement or alleged
infringement of any patent trademark, copyright or other intellectual
property right by Telaxus LLC, even if Telaxus LLC or Telaxus LLC's
authorized representative has been advised of the possibility of such
damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of
liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above
limitation or exclusion may not apply to You. Telaxus LLC will not be
liable for 1) loss of, or damage to, your records or data or 2) any
damages claimed by you based on any third party claim. In no event
shall Telaxus LLC's total liability to you for all damages, losses, and
causes of action (whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or
otherwise) exceed the amount paid by you for the Software.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">CONTROLLING LAW AND SEVERABILITY</span>.
This License shall be governed by and construed under the laws of
Pennsylvania, USA. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction
finds any provision of this License or portion thereof, to be
unenforceable, that provision of the License shall be enforced to the
maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties,
and the remainder of this License shall continue in full force and
effect.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">COMPLETE AGREEMENT.</span>
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the use of the Software and the related documentation, and
supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements,
written or oral, regarding such subject matter. No amendment to or
modification of this License will be binding unless in writing and
signed by a duly authorized representative of Telaxus LLC.</body></html>
